Brief description of submitted files:

src/sample/JavaFXDemo.java
    - The JavaFXDemo class contains the main method. This class demonstrates a JavaFX application using a BorderPane,
      buttons, and 3D sphere. The application begins with the sphere bouncing around within the Pane element embedded
      in the center of the BorderPane. When the user clicks the rightButton, the label on the left changes. When the
      user clicks the bottomButton, the sphere changes color. Motion logic for the sphere, shading/lighting, and sound
      have been added to demonstrate additional capabilities.
